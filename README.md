Welcome to LowThrustOpt! 
This is a set of tools in Julia for low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization in the CRTBP

This software was developed by Nathan L. Parrish in support of his dissertation research at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2018. The author may be reached at nathan.parrish@gmail.com. 

The code was all functional at the time of publishing. Note that because Julia is still a "young" language, there is a good chance some things will need to be updated. The following were subject to changes during development, and everything is functional under the following versions: 
-Mac OSX 10.13.4
-Julia v0.6.2.2
-DifferentialEquations v4.5.0
-Plots v0.16.0
-PlotlyJS v0.10.2
